# Block It Yourself

Really [simple](https://github.com/petrkle/block-it-yourself/blob/master/block.js) and secure ads blocking for Chrome. Inspired by [simpleblock](https://github.com/slingamn/simpleblock)

## Why another ad blocker?

Ads blocking extensions require premissions to access and modify all
pages what are you seeing. Including webmail, internet banking and other
private sites. It's OK because they need remove some parts from it.

But browser extensions have automatic updates and original author can
sell extension to "bad guys". So its more secure block ads yourself,
without this danger.

## Usage ##

1. fork on GitHub
2. clone to your disk
3. modify [filters.js](https://github.com/petrkle/block-it-yourself/blob/master/filters.js)
4. Open chrome://extensions/ then select developer mode and load extension from disk
